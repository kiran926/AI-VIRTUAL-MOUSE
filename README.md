# AI-VIRTUAL-MOUSE WITH HAND GESTURE RECOGNITION

The purpose of this project report is to present the culmination of our efforts in developing an AI Virtual Mouse with Hand Gesture Recognition system. Our primary objective is to innovate within the realm of human-computer interaction by offering a novel interface that transcends the limitations of traditional input devices. By harnessing the power of AI and computer vision technologies, we aim to address user needs for more intuitive and efficient interaction methods while exploring the technical intricacies of gesture recognition in real-time scenarios. Through this project, we strive to contribute to the advancement of research in AI, computer vision, and human-computer interaction, with a focus on practical application and user experience enhancement. Furthermore, this report serves as a roadmap for future endeavors, outlining avenues for further research, development, and improvement in the field of interactive computing.

# Requirements:
Following modules need to be installed for it to work properly:

OpenCV

Mediapipe

Autopy

NUMPY


# Libraries and Frameworks:

1.	OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library):

OpenCV is a widely-used open-source library for computer vision tasks. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and algorithms for image and video processing, including functionalities for hand detection, tracking, and gesture recognition.

2.	Mediapipe:

Mediapipe is a framework developed by Google for building perception pipelines. It provides pre-trained models and pipelines for tasks such as hand tracking and pose estimation, which can be integrated into the virtual mouse system to enhance its functionality.


3.	NumPy

  NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing and numerical operations in Python. It  provides efficient data structures and algorithms for handling multidimensional arrays and performing mathematical computations, which are essential for processing image data and implementing machine learning algorithms.

4.	AutoPy
Autopy is a cross-platform library for simulating keyboard and mouse inputs in Python. It can be used to control the mouse cursor and perform mouse clicks programmatically, enabling interaction with the virtual mouse system.

# Important Note:
I faced alot of dependency issues throughout this project. Some of the issues and their solutions are as follows:

1. autopy not installing: This is because autopy currently doesn't support Python versions above 3.8
   
2. webcam not opening: It was a bug in mediapipe and was fixed in latest python versions
